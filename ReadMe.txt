Bundle_Util

    Go into config.properties and set the 'java_path', 'bundletool_jar_path'
    and 'android_sdk_path' if needed.

    The Dialogs for each command give you the most important
    options.

    All other options are in config.properties.
    If you want, you can create multiple versions of an option and
    uncomment the one you want to use for a particular project.

    Changes to config.properties are automatically refreshed
    so you don't have to restart the app.    

Project Home:
    Along with the Project Home directory it also stores
    the project's path to it's App Bundle to help populate any
    path fields in the command Dialogs.
    
Select Device:
    Allows you to select the target device, or Emulator,
    if you are running more than one.
    The currently selected device is shown in the
    lower status bar.

Release and Debug Menu items:
    These are just to change the directory name, 'release' or 'debug', in the
    App Bundle path from what was stored.



Release notes:

    Bundle_Util 1.0.1:
        Surrounded more options using paths with double quotes.
 
    Bundle_Util 1.0.2:
        New Help button shows 'help [command]'.
        Cleanup.

        
Please let me know of any issues so that I can fix them.
Let me know what commands I should move into or out of the command Dialogs
label changes or other improvements.
